# User Quota Script

This script is to help users using ``bash`` to figure out their quota, find the top 20 largest files in their ``/home/$USER`` directory, and/or find all the files modified within the last 24hours within the same directory. 

Pretty straight forward:

1. Clone 
2. Set to executable
3. Run
4. ???
5. PROFIT!

```
git clone https://github.com/cfultz/NRAOQuota
cd quota-script
chmod +x quotafinder.sh
./quota.sh
```
